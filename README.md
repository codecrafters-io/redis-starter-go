# Redis Solution Starter - Golang

This is a starting point for Golang solutions to the ['Build Your
Own Redis' Challenge](https://rohitpaulk.com/articles/redis-challenge).

**Steps to get started**:

- Ensure you have `python` installed locally
- Clone this repository

**Workflow**:

- Run `make download_tester_mac` (or `download_tester_linux`, if you're running
  linux)
- Run `make test`. You should see a failure message at this point.
- Implement the required feature in `app/main.py`, iterate until `make test`
  passes. (If you want more verbose output for errors, use `make test_debug`
  instead of `make test`)
- Bump `current_stage` in your Makefile to go to the next stage!

**Leaderboard**:

If you'd like to be included in [the
leaderboard](https://jayantbh.github.io/redis-challenge-leaderboard-ui/):

- Ask Paul for an API key
- Ensure your API key is available as `$REDIS_CHALLENGE_API_KEY` (env var)
- After completing a stage, run `make test_and_report` to update your
  leaderboard state
